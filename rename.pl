# Quick script to rename files in the local working directory.
# Either all files in a specific folder or the files with a specific extension or pattern in the name
# Either adding something at the beginning or at the end or both.
# I will implement some ways to completely rename it, but for more complex opperations I recommend "RenameMaster"
# Rename Master: http://www.joejoesoft.com/vcms/108/

# So far, the only implemented set is to add a prefix and/or a suffix after the name, but before the extention.
